# Weather Station
This is the GitHub for the CSM Weather station project.

The goal for this weather station is to collect pressure/temperature/humidity/VOC/radiation measurements from an Arduino system, send it to a Raspberry Pi over LoRa, and publish that data in the cloud for other people to view.  Measurements will also be stored over time so that people can view graphs of the data.

Detailed information can be found on the CSM Robotics Club "Weather-Station-Documentation" repository.
