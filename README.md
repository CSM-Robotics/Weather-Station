# Weather-Station
College of San Mateo Weather Station project code

## Kyle's Rules
	
	If you have previous C/C++ experience, please don't write bad code and ask me to look at it.
	If you don't have previous C/C++ experience, feel free to ask questions about what the above phrase means.
	If you want to add code to this repository, you must have a way to prove to me it works before I'll look at it.  (Not asking for bug-free code, but please run it >1 time(s))
	Once your code works, either craete a PR or send the .ino files to me via email or something.
