# Weather-Station
This is the GitHub for the CSM Weather station project.

The goal for this weather station is to collect pressure/temperature/humidity/VOC/radiation measurements from an Arduino system, send it to a Raspberry Pi over LoRa, and publish that data somewhere in the cloud for other people to view.  Measurements will also be stored over time so that people can view graphs of the data.

More detailed information can be found on the CSM Robotics Club "Weather-Station-Documentation" repository.

## Safety Information
- The boards are assembled with leaded solder.  Wash your hands after touching hardware.
- If the VOC or Radiation measurements are way off, the sensors are probably broken.  Check the news before scaring yourself.
